"""
Smart Library System â€“ Python Practice Task

Q1. Create two dictionaries:
    - library_members: to store all members and their borrowed books.
    - book_catalog: to store available books in the library.

Q2. create_member() Function:
    - Ask the user to enter a unique member_id.
    - Check if the member already exists.
    - If not, ask for the member's full name.
    - Add the new member to the library_members dictionary with an empty list of borrowed books.

Q3. insert_book() Function:
    - Ask for a unique book ID and book title.
    - Check whether the book ID already exists in the book_catalog.
    - If not, add the book to the catalog.

Q4. borrow_book() Function:
    - Ask for the member_id.
    - Check if the member exists.
    - If yes, check how many books they have borrowed (maximum = 3).
    - Display available books from book_catalog.
    - Ask for the book ID to borrow and add that book to the member's list.

Q5. delete_member() Function:
    - Ask for the member_id.
    - If the member exists, remove them from the library_members dictionary.

Q6. view_member_info() Function:
    - Ask for the member_id.
    - If the member exists, display their name and list of borrowed books.

Q7. view_all_members() Function:
    - Check if there are any members in the dictionary.
    - Loop through all members and print their ID, name, and borrowed books.

Q8. 
    - Display a menu with the following options:
        1. Create Member
        2. Insert Book
        3. Borrow Book
        4. Delete Member
        5. View Member Info
        6. View All Members
        7. Exit
    - Ask the user to enter a choice and call the correct function.
    - Loop until the user chooses to Exit.
